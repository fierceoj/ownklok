# CVE-2020-8790
>The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) has weak password requirements combined with improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts, which could allow a remote attacker to discover user credentials and obtain access via a brute force attack.

## ownklok_bf.py
>PoC to demonstrate "CWE-307: Improper Restrictions on Excessive Authentication Attempts" on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3). It will run through 100 login attempts through the API before successfully logging in on the 101st try. It is not designed to actually discover passwords. 

## ownklok_bf_crack.py
>This script performs brute force discovery of 6-digit non-repeating passwords on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3). It is a PoC working example designed to demonstrate the weak password requirements and insufficient brute force protection mechanisms of the app, and is not a full-fledged brute force utility. Therefore, I have not included:
>- multiprocessing / parallelism
>- support for password formats other than 6-digit non-repeating

## Usage
```python3 ownklok_bf.py <victim_email_address>``` <br/>
