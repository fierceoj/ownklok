# Recommendations to Users

Given the security vulnerabilities in the OKLOK mobile application, users should be aware of the following warnings and recommendations:

- Do not rely on any lock that uses the OKLOK app to secure anything valuable. It is trivial for an attacker to unlock the lock using one of several working methods. 
- An attacker can obtain user information for any random (non-targeted) user account. 
  - Do not use a password for the OKLOK app that you use elsewhere (It is bad security practice to reuse passwords in general). 
  - Do not use personally identifying names for the lock, fingerprints, or account nickname.
  - Do not register an OKLOK account with an email address that you wish to keep private.
- Legitimate OKLOK emails come from app[@]oklock[.]net with an originating IP address in the 198.11.142.0/24 range (Alibaba). The only OKLOK emails I have seen for the FB50 2.3 lock are automated verification code emails. 
  - Be vigilant of OKLOK phishing emails and social engineering tactics. Attackers can obtain and use real user account information as a pretext to make the email seem legitimate.
  - Be aware that an attacker could mess with your account or lock first, and then send a malicious email notifying you of the unauthorized actions. An attacker could use the email to deliver a malicious payload or phishing link.
- To mitigate some of the possible attacks, use a strong and unique password and be aware of social engineering tactics.
  - Understand that an attacker can still change your password to gain access to the OKLOK account and the lock.
