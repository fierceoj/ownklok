# CVE-2020-8790
>The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) has weak password requirements combined with improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts, which could allow a remote attacker to discover user credentials and obtain access via a brute force attack.

## ownklok_bf.py
>PoC to demonstrate "CWE-307: Improper Restrictions on Excessive Authentication Attempts" on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3). It runs through 100 intentional bad login attempts before successfully logging in with the known password on the 101st try. It is not designed to actually discover passwords. 

## ownklok_bf_crack.py
>PoC code for brute force discovery of 6-digit non-repeating passwords on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3). The script is designed to demonstrate the brute force login vulnerability with a simple example, so it is not a full-fledged brute force utility. Therefore, I have not included:
>- multiprocessing / parallelism
>- support for password formats other than 6-digit non-repeating

## Usage
```python3 ownklok_bf.py <victim_email_address>``` <br/>
```python3 ownklok_bf_crack.py <victim_email_address>```

## Demos
Both demos illustrate a brute force simulation against a dummy "victim" account that was created with the 6-digit non-repeating password "012683". 

The ownklok_bf.py demo shows 100 consecutive login requests through the API, followed by a successful login. The password is given as input to the script, so this demonstrates "CWE-307: Improper Restrictions on Excessive Authentication Attempts" but does not discover a password. The total execution time will vary depending on your setup. 

The onklok_bf_crack.py demo shows a brute force password crack, which guesses 6-digit non-repeating permutations until the password is found. The total execution time will vary depending on your setup.
