# CVE-2020-8791
>The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) allows remote attackers to submit API requests using authenticated but unauthorized tokens, resulting in IDOR issues. A remote attacker can use their own authenticated token to make unauthorized API requests on behalf of arbitrary user IDs. Valid and current user IDs are simple to guess because of the user ID assignment convention used by the app. A remote attacker could harvest email addresses, unsalted MD5 password hashes, owner-assigned lock names, and owner-assigned fingerprint names for any list of arbitrary user IDs.

### ownklok_idor
> Obtain email address, unsalted MD5 password hash, lock name, fingerprint name, and more, for user accounts of the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3)

### Usage
```python3 ownklok_idor.py <start_of_range> <end_of_range> <attacker_email_address>```

`<start_of_range>` = the first victim userID in the range <br/>
`<end_of_range>` = the upper bound of the victim userID range (non-inclusive) <br/>
`<attacker_email_address>` = the email address of the attacker account, which will be used to generate an accepted token for the HTTP headers
