# Mobile App Interface
Attempt to add an already-bound lock by manually entering its barcode into "Add by ID No." in the app. The app will display the email address of the account to which the lock is bound, as well as the lock name assigned by the owner.

# ownklok_barcode.py
Construct valid barcodes from arbitrary numeric inputs and discover account email addresses, lock names, and more.

# ownklok_chain.py


### Usage
```python3 ownklok_barcode.py <start_of_range> <end_of_range> <attacker_email_address>```

`<start_of_range>` = the first number to try for barcode construction
`<end_of_range>` = the upper bound of the range for barcode guesses (non-inclusive)
`<attacker_email_address>` = the email address of the attacker account that will be used to generate an accepted token
