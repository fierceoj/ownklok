# CVE-2020-8790
>The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) has weak password requirements combined with improper restriction of excessive authentication attempts, which could allow a remote attacker to discover user credentials and obtain access via a brute force attack.

### ownklok_bf
>This script is a simple Proof of Concept to demonstrate "CWE-307: Improper Restrictions on Excessive Authentication Attempts" on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3). It will run through 100 login attempts through the API before successfully logging in on the 101st try. It is not designed to actually discover passwords. 

### ownklok_pw
>This script brute forces 6 character numeric passwords on the OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3). It is a PoC designed to demonstrate the weak password requirements and insufficient brute force protection mechanisms of the app via a working example, and is not a full-fledged brute force utility. Therefore, I have not included:
>- multiprocessing
>- support for other password types (brute forces 6-digit non-repeating passwords only)

### Usage
```python3 ownklok_bf.py <victim_email_address>``` <br/>
```python3 ownklok_pw.py <victim_email_address>```
