# CVE-2020-8792
>The OKLOK (3.1.1) mobile companion app for Fingerprint Bluetooth Padlock FB50 (2.3) has an information-exposure issue. An attempt to add an already-bound lock by its barcode in the app reveals the email address of the account to which the lock is bound, as well as the name of the lock. Valid barcode inputs can be easily guessed because barcode strings follow a predictable pattern. Correctly guessed valid barcode inputs entered through the app interface disclose a user's email address and lock name, while correctly guessed valid barcode inputs entered via specially crafted API requests, used in conjunction with the userID IDOR vulnerability in CVE-2020-8791, reveal account information including email addresses, unsalted MD5 password hashes, owner-given lock names, and owner-given fingerprint names for any list of arbitrary user IDs. 

### Mobile App Interface
>Attempt to add an already-bound lock by manually entering its barcode into "Add by ID No." in the app. The app will display the email address of the account to which the lock is bound, as well as the lock name assigned by the owner.

### ownklok_barcode.py
>Construct valid barcodes from arbitrary numeric inputs and discover account email addresses, lock names, and more.

### ownklok_chain.py
TBD

### Usage
```python3 ownklok_barcode.py <start_of_range> <end_of_range> <attacker_email_address>```

`<start_of_range>` = the first number to try for barcode construction <br/>
`<end_of_range>` = the upper bound of the range for barcode guesses (non-inclusive) <br/>
`<attacker_email_address>` = the email address of the attacker account, which will be used to generate an accepted token for the HTTP headers
